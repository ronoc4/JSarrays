/**

 * Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

 The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
 The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
 So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;.

 Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

 For example:

 var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

 getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
 // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

 No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
 */
//Start timer
var begin=Date.now();

var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

function getMaxProfit(stockPriceYesterday) {
    var maxProfit = 0;

    //Go through each time
    for(var outerTime = 0; outerTime < stockPriceYesterday.length; outerTime++) {

        //go through every OTHER time
        for(var innerTime = 0; innerTime < stockPriceYesterday.length; innerTime++) {

            //Find earlier and later times
            var earlierTime = Math.min(outerTime, innerTime);
            var laterTime = Math.max(outerTime, innerTime);

            //Find earlier and later prices
            var earlierPrice = stockPriceYesterday[earlierTime];
            var laterPrice = stockPriceYesterday[laterTime];

            // see what our profit would be if we bought at the
            // min price and sold at the current price
            var potentialPrice = laterPrice - earlierPrice;

            //Update maxProfit if we can do better
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialPrice);
        }
